## **SizedBox(height: size.height * 0.03)** :

means you’re setting the height to 3% of the device’s screen height.

So if the device screen height is, for example, 800 pixels:

**0.03 * 800 = 24 pixels of vertical space.**

It’s a great way to make your UI spacing responsive and proportional across different screen sizes.
